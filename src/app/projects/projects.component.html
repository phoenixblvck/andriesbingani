    <p>As I have mentioned on the home page of my site, I am a committed and proactive full stacks software developer.
        I have worked on a lot of projects throughout my career - some of them for fun and some of them to make extra cash.
        On this part of the site, I have listed some of the interesting project I have worked on either as a team or by myself.
        For started this whole site was coded in angular2+ and I am hosting it on gitlab pages. The email sending part was done in php 
        and ajax.

                <h1>WHAT DO I DO AT INVESTEC?</h1>
                <p>
                    For the past year, I have been part of one of the most skilled teams in my department and met some of the greatest minds at Investec.<br><br>
                    In terms of my job, we mostly work on community-based apps which we use mostly Angularjs for our frontend and angular 7 for our new stuff. For context, we have apps that a specific audience mainly logins into and we push new features in our apps by adding new components or updating existing ones. For our backend, we use the softwareAG stack (Bpm, ESB, etc.) but we use Oracle to enable hard deployments as softwareAG has a lot of bottlenecks when comes to that. For version control, we use crossvista and gitlab. For testing, we use Nightwatch. It's really good but sometimes causes a lot of inconsistencies when it comes to testing it uses a lot of ram and fails tests cause of timeouts. Part of the team has started looking into cypress to use an alternative.<br><br>
                    I have worked on a lot of projects in my time here which include a dry cleaning service that helps the current with querying the status of submitted items for our internal stuff user. For years, this has been done manually and caused inconsistencies in data capturing and lead to items being lost. I was the frontend developer in this project and used Angular 7, CSS and bootstrap 4 to create the frontend. I'm currently working on an info services piece using Angularjs which is used by the ban.

                <p>
                    Cäb is a ride sharing app that I worked on by myself to try and beat companies like uber and taxify in Congo. The idea mostly came from a friend and he owned a couple of taxis and his business was still on its start up phase.<br><br>

                    The app's frontend was built using Android studios for native android devices and I used php, ajax and sql to handle the backend process. For locations, we used google maps api. The app is available in on the playstore <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cab.guest_plxcnd.maps&gl=ZA" target="blank">here</a>

                <h1>Robotics, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence</h1>
                <p>
                   Robotics is one of my favorite topics and I have been involved in the field for some time now. In one of my projects, I used ROS, python and openCV to program a Robot hand to write stuff line images on paper. The research paper can be found <a href="#" target="blank">here</a><br><br>
                My current research involves robocup which is an international joint project to promote (Distributed) Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Robotics, and related fields. It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. RoboCup chose to use soccer game as a central topic of research, aiming at innovations to be applied for socially significant problems and industries. The ultimate goal of the RoboCup project is By 2050, develop a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot that can win against the human world champion team in soccer! In order for a robot team to actually play a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration and communication, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor-fusion. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a software platform (soccer server) for research on the software aspects of RoboCup, which is what I am involved in mostly we can't really afford expensive robots for now. You can read more about it at RoboCup.
