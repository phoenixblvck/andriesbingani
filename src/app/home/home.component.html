            I am a committed and proactive full stacks software developer seeking to gain familiarity in the field of Computer Science. 
            Over the past three years, I managed to learn over 15 different programming languages, relative to the three main languages that were taught at school, by learning them during my spare time. 
            In terms of programming experience I have 2 years worth of experience in Angular and Node. 
            I have 6 years worth of experience in C++, 4 years worth of experience in Java and Python (mostly the languages I used during my studies).

                    I finished my matric with six distinctions at Thuto Lesedi secondary school in Vosloorus from 2009 to 2013. 
                    This was where my interest with computers first started. 
                    This is because I was part of the School's press team. 
                    I started building my knowledge with computers when I was editing movies and pictures using a mac book.

                    I completed my Bsc in Computer Sciences and Computational and Applied Maths, and my BSc honors (with distinctions) in Computer Sciences at the university of the Witwatersrand from 2014 to 2017 while being sponsored by peermont and investec. 
                    I am currently enrolled for my masters in Computer Sciences at the university of the Witwatersrand.

                    I am currently a full stack software engineer at investec. 
                    I have worked on a lot ideas the past years and most just being deployed and not making as much profit as we hoped. 
                    For example, I partner up with a friend of mine from congo in an attemp to build a ride app in his country first as it was still not know to the public. It's listed on the playstore as CÃ¤b. 
                    I also pathnered with friend of mine to make an online shop a few years back which is Shop with stylist, these are a potion of the many projects that I have gotten into, checkout the <a routerLink="/projects">projects</a> page.
                    In terms of employment, I am currently looking a position that would be best for gaining experience in the field while further enabling my personal and professional development.
